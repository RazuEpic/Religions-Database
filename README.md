# Religions-Database
To add a religion to the program, create a new text file with the name corresponding to the religion (e.g., `Christianity.txt`, `Islam.txt`, `Judaism.txt`). Each text file should contain the religion's information in the following order, each on a new line: the name of the religion, its symbols, sacred text, key beliefs, practices/rituals, gods, sacred leaders, and historical background. For example, `Christianity.txt` would include details such as "The Cross" for symbols and "The Holy Bible" for sacred texts, followed by the religion's history and beliefs. Once the text file is created, the program will automatically read and display the information when selected. Simply ensure the text file is in the same directory as your script, and you can easily add more religions by creating and populating new files following this format.
